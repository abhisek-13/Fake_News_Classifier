# Fake News Classifier

## Overview
The Fake News Classifier is a machine learning project that uses TensorFlow to detect and classify fake news articles. The model achieves an accuracy of 97%, making it highly effective at distinguishing between real and fake news. This repository contains a single Python file with the complete code for building and training the model. You can use this code as a reference to build your own model and deploy it on your website.

## Features
- **High Accuracy:** The model achieves a 97% accuracy in classifying fake news.
- **TensorFlow Implementation:** Uses the TensorFlow module for building and training the model.
- **Reference Code:** Includes a single Python file that can be used as a reference for building and deploying the model.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Programming language used for model development.
- **TensorFlow:** Machine learning framework used for building and training the fake news classifier.
